# 📚 Java Preparation

Java Preparation is a personal learning project designed to aid my understanding and competency in Java, specifically in preparation for exams and more complex projects.

## 🎯 What's Inside

This repository is a compendium of several key Java concepts and applications, including:

1. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** - Fundamental OOP concepts and patterns are explored here.
2. **Swing** - Projects demonstrating the use of Java's built-in graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit.
3. **Java Core Basics** - Foundational knowledge of Java, including syntax, data structures, and standard libraries.
4. **ToolBox Utility Class** - A utility class with various helper methods for tasks such as array manipulation, sorting, random number generation, and encryption.

## 🚀 Projects

The repository is organized into the following main projects:

### Bitwise Calculator

A unique calculator app that exclusively utilizes bitwise operations for its calculations.

### Bank Account

This console-based project replicates the functionality of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM), providing a textual interface for bank transactions.

### Swing Clock

A simple yet effective clock application created using Java's Swing library and multi-threading capabilities.

### ToolBox Class

An utility class, `ToolBox`, that provides several utility functions for:

- Converting arrays to strings with `arrToString` methods.
- Displaying array contents with `showArr` methods.
- Sorting arrays in ascending or descending order with `sortArrAscending` and `sortArrDescending` methods.
- Generating random numbers with `getIntRandomNumber` method.
- Generating sequential integer arrays with `getInt1DArr` and `getInt2DArr` methods.
- Encrypting and decrypting strings with `encrypt`, `decrypt`, `encryptCaesar` and `decryptCaesar` methods.
